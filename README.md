E-Commerce Website in Pure JavaScript with Bulma, JSON Server, and Axios
This is an e-commerce website built as part of Collabera's JavaScript training, showcasing the use of pure JavaScript, Bulma as a CSS framework, JSON Server for fake API data, and Axios for HTTP requests.

The website features a product listing page, a login page, and a checkout page. Users can register and login, browse products, add items to their cart, update the quantity of items, remove items from their cart, and complete the checkout process by filling out a form with their shipping information.

The fake API data is served by JSON Server, allowing for easy testing and development without the need for a real backend server. Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the API and handle responses.

Bulma is used to style the website and provide a responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile devices. Thie project also uses Font Awesome for icons and the logo was created using a stock image from [Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/technology).

#Installation and Usage
To run the website locally, clone the repository and install dependencies with npm install. Start the JSON Server with json-server -w data/data.json. Access the website through the main end point html/dashboard.html
