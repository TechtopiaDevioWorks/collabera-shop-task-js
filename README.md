E-Commerce Website in Pure JavaScript with Bulma, JSON Server, and Axios
This is an e-commerce website built as part of Collabera's JavaScript training, showcasing the use of pure JavaScript, Bulma as a CSS framework, JSON Server for fake API data, and Axios for HTTP requests.

The website features a product listing page, a product detail page, a shopping cart page, and a checkout page. Users can browse products, add items to their cart, update the quantity of items, remove items from their cart, and complete the checkout process by filling out a form with their shipping and payment information.

The fake API data is served by JSON Server, allowing for easy testing and development without the need for a real backend server. Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the API and handle responses.

Bulma is used to style the website and provide a responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile devices.
